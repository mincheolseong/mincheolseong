I'm an army officer who wants to go to graduate school.
===========
* After being discharged from the military, I hope to enter the direct Ph.D. program at a school in the United States of America.
* I'm currently learning Reinforcement Learning.
* I'm currently conducting research to solve the UAV optimal path problem with Reinforcement Learning :airplane:.
* I'm using GitHub to write a high-quality Statement of Purpose with my research results.
* If you have any questions for me, please feel free to leave an email. :smile:
