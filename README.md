I'm an army officer who wants to go to graduate school.
===========
* After my military discharge, I aspire to enroll in a direct Ph.D. program at a school in the United States.
* Currently, my studies focus on Reinforcement Learning.
* I'm conducting research to address the UAV optimal path problem using Reinforcement Learning :airplane:.
* I use GitHub to document my research findings and craft a high-quality Statement of Purpose.
* If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me an email :smile:.
